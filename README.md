# MINERAL EXPLORATION, MAPPING & MARKET INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM
## Scope Definition

**Business Overview**

This integrated mineral intelligence platform connects geologists, surveyors, mining companies, investors, and government agencies while automating mineral exploration reporting, geological mapping, valuation intelligence, and market analysis. Real-time data on mineral type, quality, quantity, and regional demand enables informed investment recommendations, reduces exploration uncertainty, and accelerates the movement of mineral resources from discovery to market.
By enabling transparent digital records of mineral findings and maintaining structured miner and company profiles, the system improves investment confidence, supports access to financing, and minimizes dependence on informal intermediaries. It functions as a comprehensive Mining Management Information System (MIS), strengthening resource planning, regulatory oversight, supply chain efficiency, and long-term mineral sector development through data-driven decision-making.

**Problem Statement**

In Rwanda, mineral exploration data is fragmented, manually recorded, and poorly coordinated across regions and institutions. The absence of a centralized and integrated mineral information system forces investors and mining companies to rely on intermediaries, limits market transparency, delays decision-making, and results in significant revenue losses. Additionally, the lack of reliable digital mineral records reduces investor confidence and restricts access to financing for legitimate mining operations.

**Key Objectives**

***1. System Objectives***

*Automate mineral exploration data capture,validation, and registration across all surveyed regions.

*Provide real-time mineral valuation and market intelligence to support investor and management decisions.

*Enable investors to easily identify mineral-rich regions suitable for establishing mining companies.

***2. Management Objectives***

*Improve transparency and accountability in mineral reporting and valuation.

*Support strategic planning and licensing decisions using accurate analytical reports.

*Strengthen national mineral resource governance and revenue optimization.


***3. Technical Objectives***

*Implement structured data storage using an Oracle Database with enforced integrity (PKs, FKs, constraints, triggers).

*Integrate analytical reporting and decision-support queries for mineral quantity, quality, and value assessment.

*Enable scalable, secure, and high-performance data processing for long-term mineral intelligence management.

**Mineral Exploration & Reporting Process**

Start: Identification of a target region for mineral exploration

End: Management or investor decision based on analytical reports and valuation insights

**Expected Outcomes**

*Centralized, validated, and reliable mineral exploration database

*Reduced data redundancy and improved data consistency

*Faster, evidence-based investment and management decision-making

*Improved transparency, accountability, and investor confidence in the mining sector
